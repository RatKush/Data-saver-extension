| **Category** | **Typical Percentage of Total Page Weight** | **Notes** |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| Images (e.g., product photos, background graphics, logos) | 30% - 60% | Images are consistently the single largest component for most sites, particularly e-commerce and media-heavy blogs. |
| Media (Videos/Audio) | 10% - 35% | This varies wildly. A site with an embedded, auto-playing video will have a much higher percentage. For simple blogs, it might be near 0%. |
| Ads/Third-Party (Scripts, Banners, Pixels) | 10% - 30% | Includes the weight of ad banners, tracking scripts, and other third-party services, which can significantly impact performance. |
